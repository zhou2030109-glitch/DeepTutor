## Writing DNA Skill

- Project: [larashero3-dotcom/writing-dna-skill](https://github.com/larashero3-dotcom/writing-dna-skill)
- Source commit: `ee3d97ee27268004b5187d97711161f44fc4aae4`
- License: MIT
- Vendored path: `plugins/style-writer/vendor/writing-dna-skill`
- Adapted workflow: isolated author corpus, editable DNA drafts, explicit
  human approval, versioned profiles, and optional less-AI-tone rewriting.

The complete upstream license and attribution are preserved at
`plugins/style-writer/vendor/writing-dna-skill/LICENSE`. DeepTutor's desktop
integration keeps each writing space under its own plugin-data directory and
does not write the corpus or DNA profile into global memory.

## CSSwitch

- Project: [SuperJJ007/CSSwitch](https://github.com/SuperJJ007/CSSwitch)
- Source commit: `4e0af6ba7909dca22f1257b168172ecbe4af4836`
- License: MIT
- Copyright: Copyright (c) 2026 shanjunjie
- Adapted concepts: PKCE loopback login, auth generations, atomic credential updates, model-catalog cache invalidation, and redacted operation states.

DeepTutor's Codex OAuth support draws on the design concepts listed above and
implements them independently against DeepTutor's own settings directory, model
catalog, and provider lifecycle. The MIT license text from that source commit
